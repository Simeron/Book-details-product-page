## Book product details page 📚📖🛍🛒


### To build this 'book product details page' I decided to build it in pure vanilla javascript, as this is what I feel the most comfortable with at the moment. I have built websites with WordPress this is what I have built all of my freelancing websites in. I have also had exposure to vue.js in the past as well, although this was some years ago now. In more recent years I have used react.js. But for the complexity of the task I decided vanilla js would be good.

Please follow the steps below to preview my work and let me know if you have any questions at all.

### Enjoy!

**If I had more time…** I have tried to hit all of the required items, but... Given I had more time to complete this challenge there are a few things I would change / edit / add to further improve this page. There are also a few things in this list which I would do slightly differently now I am slightly reflecting back on working on this task:

- I would have like to have found a way to get multiple reviews showing or at least have built in an option for more reviews if they were available
- Researched future into more book product page designs for an even more intuitive design
- Go with my gut - I picked a new CSS framework I hadn’t used before I definitely needed more time to experiment with it and try it out before trying to use it on something new. I ended up switching over to one I have use multiple times in the past which took me next to no time and left me thinking why didn’t I do this first… 
- Have some kind of mock purchase in place maybe, just to go slightly beyond what the product page looks like
- Redesign the ‘More about this book’ section so that it all ties together a little better
- Do a bit more on the accessibility side
- Changed my ID’s to classes
- Use SCSS
